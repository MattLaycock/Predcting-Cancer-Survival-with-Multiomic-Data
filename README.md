This is the code for my master's project on predicting cancer survival using multiomic data, expanding on the DROEG model.
One file contains the evaluation of the existing model.
Ultimately I create my own multilayer perceptron model to predict drug response effectiveness in a binary format using thresholds set out in DROEG.
This model is then tested on TCGA data to test the adaptiveness of the model to unseen data.
